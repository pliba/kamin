The directory can be obtained either by copying the file distr.tar.Z,
then uncompressing and de-tar'ing, or by copying the files directly
out of the distr directory.  If copying the .Z file, be sure to set
the "binary" flag.

The contents of the distr directory are fully explained in its
README file.  That directory also includes a file ERRATA.  It lists all
known substantive errors in the text.  (Further contributions are always
welcome.)

The directory C-distr contains C versions of all of the interpreters
except those from Chapter 10 (various versions of garbage-
collection).  These were obtained automatically by using the
Pascal-to-C translator p2c.  It is recommended that these be used
only if a Pascal compiler is unavailable.  The contents of the
C-distr directory are explained in its README file.
